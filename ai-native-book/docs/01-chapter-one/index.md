<!-- Generated for Chapter 1: Foundations of Physical AI -->

For the full course overview and capstone description, see the
[Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Course Specification](./00-physical-ai-course-spec.md).

## Chapter Overview

**Duration:** Weeks 1-2  
**Focus:** Foundational concepts, technical foundations, and ethical considerations

Chapter 1 establishes the foundational knowledge required for understanding Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This chapter introduces core concepts, technical foundations, performance constraints, ethical considerations, and sets the stage for the capstone project. Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the field's history, current state, and the technical stack used throughout the course.

## Learning Outcomes

### Conceptual Understanding

- Understand the definition and historical context of Physical AI
- Grasp the fundamental concepts of embodied intelligence
- Learn the perception-decision-action loop
- Understand why humanoid robots are important and their applications
- Recognize the challenges unique to physical AI systems
- Understand the technical foundations and tool choices for the course
- Learn about performance constraints and real-world considerations
- Develop awareness of ethical considerations in robotics

### Practical Skills

- Understand the course structure and capstone scope
- Learn lab governance and best practices
- Familiarize with the technical stack (Python, ROS 2, simulation tools)
- Prepare for hands-on development work

### Capstone Relevance

- Students will understand the scope and expectations of the capstone project
- Foundation for all subsequent chapters and practical work
- Establishes the context for building an autonomous humanoid system

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized into several foundational topics:

### Course Specification

The complete course overview, including learning objectives, structure, and capstone project description.

### Technical Foundations

Understanding why Python and ROS 2 are chosen for this course, and how the technical stack supports Physical AI development.

### Performance Constraints and Ethics

Real-world considerations including performance trade-offs, safety, and ethical implications of deploying physical AI systems.

### Capstone Scope and Workflow

Detailed description of the capstone project, its scope, and the workflow students will follow.

### Lab Governance and Practice

Best practices for lab work, collaboration, and maintaining high-quality code and documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:

- Basic programming experience (Python recommended)
- Interest in robotics and artificial intelligence
- Willingness to learn new concepts and tools

## Key Takeaways

- Physical AI bridges the gap between digital intelligence and physical embodiment
- Humanoid robots offer unique advantages but face significant challenges
- The perception-decision-action loop is fundamental to embodied intelligence
- Technical choices (Python, ROS 2) balance productivity and capability
- Ethical considerations are crucial when deploying physical AI systems
- The capstone project integrates all course concepts into a practical system

## Next Chapter

After completing Chapter 1, you'll move on to Chapter 2: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2 Fundamentals), where you'll learn the middleware that connects all components of a robot system.
