## PROMPT_TEXT:

```
you git commit and push in my githup repo url = https://github.com/MaryamCoader/AISpec-Driven-Hackathon.git
```

## RESPONSE_TEXT:

The user requested to commit and push changes. I first checked the `git status` to identify any pending changes. The `git status` command reported "nothing to commit, working tree clean." This indicates that there are no modifications in the repository to commit or push at this time. I am now informing the user of this status and awaiting further instructions.
