## Prompt

/sp.implement

## Response snapshot

I have completed all implementation tasks for Chapter Three. The content for the topic files has been generated and all tasks in `tasks.md` have been marked as complete.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Implemented the content generation for Chapter Three, including structure and quality requirements.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `ai-native-book/docs/03-chapter-three/01-rl-for-robot-behaviors.md`
  - `ai-native-book/docs/03-chapter-three/02-human-robot-interaction.md`
  - `ai-native-book/docs/03-chapter-three/03-advanced-perception.md`
  - `ai-native-book/docs/03-chapter-three/04-manipulation-dexterity.md`
  - `ai-native-book/docs/03-chapter-three/05-ethical-ai-robotics.md`
  - `specs/007-write-chapter-three/tasks.md` (updated with completed tasks)
- 🔁 Next prompts: None, feature implementation complete.
- 🧠 Reflection: The content generation for Chapter Three was successfully completed, adhering to the defined word count, foundational approach building on Chapters 1 and 2, and use of illustrative examples. The Docusaurus autogeneration of the sidebar simplifies integration.
