# Research: Chapter Four Topic Selection

## Decision:
Chapter Four will focus on **Language-Guided Reasoning**.

## Rationale:
Based on the program constitution, the book covers foundational topics in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Assuming the first three chapters covered "Physical AI Fundamentals," "ROS 2 Architecture," and "Simulation & Digital Twins," the next logical step is to introduce how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to command and control robots. This topic aligns with the learning objective of "Language-Guided Reasoning."

## Alternatives Considered:
- **Perception & Navigation**: While a valid topic, it could be a very broad and deep subject. It might be better to dedicate a later chapter or multiple chapters to this.
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: This is a crucial topic, but it's more of a "how-to" for the entire robotics stack. It might be better to introduce it after all the core concepts (including perception and navigation) have been covered.
